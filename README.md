## **4. Game Features**

### **Shooting**:

- Players can shoot bullets by clicking the left mouse button.
- Bullets are created at the player's current position and travel in the direction the player is facing.

### **Enemy AI**:

- The game includes basic AI for enemies that move randomly across the terrain.
- AI uses a simple algorithm to choose a destination point and move toward it.

### **Sound Effects**:

- Each time the player shoots, a gunshot sound is played.
- Ambient sounds are used to enhance the atmosphere of the game.

### **Fog**:

- A dynamic fog system reduces visibility at longer distances, making the environment more immersive.

### **Bullet and Collision Handling**:

- Bullets are instantiated and move toward their target.
- If a bullet intersects with an enemy or object, it gets destroyed or the enemy takes damage.

## **5. Game Assets**

### **Textures**:

- **Ground Texture**: `ground.png` (Diffuse texture)
- **Weapon Model**: `gun.glb`
- **Bullet Model**: `sphere`
- **Enemy Models**: Placeholder models or custom 3D models for enemies.

### **Sounds**:

- **Gunshot Sound**: `gunshot.wav`
- **Ambient Sound**: `ambient_music.mp3`
- **Hit Sound**: `hit_sound.wav`

## **6. Code Overview**

### **Game Loop**:

The game operates in a continuous loop that updates player movements, AI actions, and interactions with the environment.

- **Player Movement**: Captures input from the keyboard and moves the player accordingly.
- **Enemy AI**: The AI moves randomly, changes direction when it reaches its destination, and occasionally reacts to the player.
- **Shooting**: A bullet is instantiated when the player clicks the mouse, and it moves in the direction the player is facing.

### **Shooting Mechanism**:

```python
def shoot():
    new_bullet = Entity(model="sphere", color=color.lime, scale=0.3, visible=True, collider="sphere", speed=bullet_speed)
    new_bullet.position = player.position + Vec3(0, 1.5, 0)
    new_bullet.rotation = player.rotation
    new_bullet.collider = "sphere"
    bullets.append(new_bullet)
```

### **Movement and Rotation of Opponent AI**:

```python
def move_opponent(opponent):
    x, y, z = random.randint(-100, 100), 0, random.randint(-100, 100)
    direction = (Vec3(x, y, z) - opponent.position).normalized()
    opponent.rotation_y = math.atan2(direction.z, direction.x) * (180 / math.pi)
    opponent.animate("position", (x, y, z), duration=20, curve=curve.linear)
    invoke(move_opponent, opponent, delay=2)
```

## **7. Known Issues and Limitations**

- **Enemy AI**: Currently basic and can get stuck in certain areas.
- **Gun Reload**: The reload mechanic is not fully functional, and ammo count is not yet implemented.
- **Fog Performance**: On lower-end systems, the dynamic fog effect may cause slight performance issues.
- **Collision Detection**: Some minor issues in collision detection for fast-moving bullets and small objects.

---

## **8. Future Updates**

- **Improved Enemy AI**: The AI will be enhanced with better pathfinding and more complex behaviors.
- **Multiplayer Mode**: The game will include support for local multiplayer.
- **Advanced Graphics**: More advanced lighting, shading, and particle effects will be implemented to improve visual quality.
- **Customization**: The player will be able to customize their weapons and character.

## **9. Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**:

- **No Sound**:

  - Make sure the sound files are correctly loaded and paths are correct.
  - Check if the sound volume is turned up in the system settings.

- **Lag/Performance Issues**:
  - Lower the graphical settings in the game options menu.
  - Ensure your system meets the minimum requirements for the game.
